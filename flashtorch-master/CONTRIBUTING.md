First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! üéâüëç

### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/MisaOgura/flashtorch/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/MisaOgura/flashtorch/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of FlashTorch will generally not be accepted.
